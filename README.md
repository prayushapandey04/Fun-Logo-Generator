## Usage

After you install inquirer, make sure that you open the file "index.js" in your integrated terminal. After this, you will be prompted with a bunch of questions regarding your logo, which you will have to answer every question. After all the questions are answered, the application will move into the "./examples" directory and will create a "logo.svg" file in that folder. Below is a link for the walkthrough video!
